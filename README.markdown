my hints for vim, written to be highlighted by (but not really indexed/searched by) the helpfile system

usage:
  :h vimhints       Opens the vimhints file at the top, in a readonly help buffer.
                    From there, you can search for stuff like normal.

maybe one day i'll write more of a plugin for this, so that it works more like my bash hints program, but for now, i'll make do with a helpfile
